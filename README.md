# E-COMMERCE-SALES-ANALYSIS
This repository contains the Excel report on "E-commerce sales analysis"

E-commerce sales is a critical revenue stream for many businesses and because of its digital nature,each transaction can be recorded and used to infer insights about a business and its products,proceses and customers.

In this project,we explore an organisation's online transactions.The raw data comprised of sales,returns,Row id,order id,ship date etc.

After a thorough data cleaning and exploratory analysis,it became clear that there are several ways to analye the data.

*The main purpose of the analysis is to explore consumer behaviour and how e-commerce companies can increase their sales accordingly.

WHAT I HAD TRIED TO ACHIEVE:-

1)Which areas are huge market for our products to better target the customers.

2)Which product do people commonly buy in a particular state as this would help us understanding the consumer behaviour and then we can give offers and discounts only on the product that people will mostly prefer to buy rather than giving it to random products.

3)which type of transactions do people prefer for the payments.

INSIGHTS GAINED:-

*At what period of time do customers like to buy more.

*Category wise profit is calculated in which category 'Technology' has highest profit so we should focus more on technology.

*sales and profit analysis on the basis of which an organisation will take further decisions.

*we have calculate year over year sales,profit,quantity and orders.

*we have also listed top 10 sub categories sales.

*States which are having highest number of sales and orders.

*Determining which part of the year the sales are more or less.

Thank you for viewing my project,any suggestions or feedbacks are welcome.
